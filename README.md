<br/>

This plugin installs a fish function wrapper around `man` that colorizes non-standard text (underlined, bold, and standout) to make reading man pages easier and more enjoyable. This idea was first inspired by [Arch Linux wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Color_output_in_console#Using_less). 

## Install

With [Oh My Fish]
```fish
$ omf install https://github.com/patrickf3139/Colored-Man-Pages
```
With [fisherman]
```fish
$ fisher patrickf3139/Colored-Man-Pages
```

## Usage
Just execute `man` as you usually would to get the colors. For example
```fish
$ man less
```
To execute vanilla `man` without the added colors, simply specify the path of the `man` binary. `which man` should output the path to the binary. For example, on OSX it is `/usr/bin/man`, so Mac users would execute
```fish
$ /usr/bin/man less
```
