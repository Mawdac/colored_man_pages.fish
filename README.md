<br/>

A wrapper around `man` that colorizes non-standard text to make reading manpages easier and more enjoyable.

## Install

With [Oh My Fish]
```fish
$ omf install https://github.com/patrickf3139/Colored-Manpages
```
With [fisherman]
```fish
$ fisher patrickf3139/Colored-Manpages
```

## Usage
Just execute `man` as you usually would to get the colors. For example
```fish
$ man less
```
To execute vanilla `man` without the added colors, simply specify the path of the `man` binary. `which man` should output the path to the binary. For example, on OSX it is `/usr/bin/man`, so Mac users would execute
```fish
$ /usr/bin/man less
```
